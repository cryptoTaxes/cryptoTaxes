Place in this folder your fullOrders.csv files, corresponding to the old
csv format used by Bittrex from 2014 till 2017.

You can recognize this old format by checking the header which is:
  OrderUuid,Exchange,Type,Quantity,Limit,CommissionPaid,Price,Opened,Closed

Notice also that these text files use UTF-16LE text format.

They can be downloaded from your Bittrex account:
