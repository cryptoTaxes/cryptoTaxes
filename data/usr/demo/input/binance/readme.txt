Place in this folder your Binance trade history in xlsx format.

Binance only lets you export your trade history in xlsx format
(from Orders -> Trade History -> Export Complete Trade History menu).

CryptoTaxes will preprocess your xlxs files in this folder and will
extract corresponding csv files into "generated" folder. Please, don't
place csv files yourself into "generated" folder as they won't be
processed by the program and could get overwritten.

Check provided TradeHistory.xlsx example file.
