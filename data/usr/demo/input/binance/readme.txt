Place in this folder your Binance trade history in csv format.

Binance only lets you export your trade history in xlsx format
(from Orders -> Trade History -> Export Complete Trade History menu).

You will have to convert your xlsx file into csv format (using some spreadsheet
application such as OpenOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel) and place the resulting
file in this folder.

Check provided TradeHistory.csv example and please note that a comma
is used as a separator for cells in same row.
